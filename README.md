# Lab 8 - Starter

1) I would put tests within a github action, so that they run automatically every time code is changed without a programmer having to manually run tests. This guarantees that tests will always run no matter how small a code change may be, as small code changes can still lead to unexpected effects. 

2) No, you would use a unit test to check a specific function, not an end to end test. An end to end test is supposed to represent end user behavior, not test specific functions.
